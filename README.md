# Aim of this project
With this project, we aim to develop an application that extracts "Location" from the identifiable named entities of a text and enables one to, given a text, search for nearby texts.

## **Install libraries for Python3** <h2>

The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
