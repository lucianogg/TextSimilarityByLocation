# Aim of this project
With this project, we aim to develop an application that extracts "Location" from the identifiable named entities of a text and enables one to, given a text, search for nearby texts. For that task, we will make use of a webpage that recognizes the named entities as dbpedia entities. Some of them have a location. From that, we can try to see where is the most important location among the entities present in the text.
